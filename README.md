# MLOps-Driven Analysis of Brazilian E-commerce Data
License: MIT

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that perform a comprehensive analysis of a Brazilian e-commerce dataset. The notebooks involve data exploration, clustering techniques, and an examination of the impact of model retraining frequency on clustering performance, all orchestrated following MLOps principles.

## Dataset
The dataset used in these notebooks contains information about various e-commerce transactions in Brazil. Details regarding the dataset's specific contents will be within the notebooks themselves.

## Contents
### 1. exploration_brasilian_ecommerce.ipynb
This notebook is dedicated to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Brazilian e-commerce dataset. It includes:

#### Data Loading: Load the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.
#### Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.
#### Data Analysis: Perform a preliminary analysis to understand the data's characteristics, patterns, and potential anomalies. This might involve visualizations, statistical summaries, etc.

### 2. clustering_comparison_brasilian_ecommerce.ipynb
This notebook advances the data analysis by applying machine learning clustering techniques. It covers:

#### Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for clustering. This might involve feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, etc.
#### Model Fitting: Fit a clustering model to the data.
#### Cluster Comparison: Compare the results of different clustering methods. This could involve comparing different clustering algorithms, or different configurations of the same algorithm.

### 3. mlops_retrain_frequency_brasilian_ecommerce.ipynb
The final notebook focuses on operational aspects of machine learning, in particular, the frequency of retraining the model. It explores:

#### Retraining Frequency: Assess the impact of retraining frequency on the performance of the clustering model.
#### Model Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of the model with different retraining frequencies.
How to Use
#### Prerequisites: Ensure that Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, and the required libraries (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, among others) are installed.
#### Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
#### Run the Notebooks: Open the Jupyter Notebooks and run each cell step by step.
